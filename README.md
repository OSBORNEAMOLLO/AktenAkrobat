#  AktenAkrobat – Health Data CLI Toolkit

AktenAkrobat is a powerful, Rust-based Command Line Interface (CLI) toolkit for secure and automated health data management. Designed to meet the demands of modern healthcare workflows, it empowers users to load, **validate**, **merge**, **summarize**, **predict risks**, and **export** patient records with a strong focus on **AI readiness**, **local-first automation**, and **privacy-by-design** principles.

---

## 🏋️‍⚖️ Overview

Health records often exist in diverse formats — CSVs, JSON exports, device readings, or clinical software logs. Consolidating and preparing them for analysis or AI training is time-consuming and error-prone.

AktenAkrobat solves this by offering a lightweight CLI-based automation tool that:

* Provides **structure and consistency** to raw records.
* Works fully **offline**, without reliance on cloud infrastructure.
* Outputs **AI-ready JSON** and other formats.

## Why a CLI Toolkit?

**Choosing a CLI (Command Line Interface) approach for AktenAkrobat was intentional**:

* ✅ **Scriptable:** Easily integrated into custom workflows and automated pipelines.
* ✅ **Lightweight:** No GUI overhead, ideal for servers or low-resource environments.
* ✅ **Portable:** Statically compiled binaries run anywhere, no setup needed.
* ✅ **Repeatable:** Enables precise, repeatable health data transformations.
* ✅ **DevOps/ML Friendly:** Pairs perfectly with cron jobs, shell scripts, or CI/CD.

This makes it **ideal for researchers, healthcare analysts, and health tech developers** working in secure or regulated environments.

##  Key Features

* ✔️ Load data from CSV or JSON (FHIR-ready input support).
* ✔️ Validate vital signs and vitals against configurable medical thresholds.
* ✔️ Summarize patient data by computing average stats (HR, BP, Temp, etc.).
* ✔️ Merge multiple datasets (e.g., daily logs) into a clean export.
* ✔️ Export structured data in CSV, JSON, and AI-ready JSON formats.
* ✔️ Predict clinical risks using rules defined in a config file.
* ✔️ Configurable via `config.toml` for custom medical thresholds.
* ✔️ Built-in dry run mode and medical mode for flexible use cases.

---

##  Linux Compatibility

AktenAkrobat is compiled using `cross` + `musl` via **GitHub Actions**, producing statically linked binaries for:

* `x86_64-unknown-linux-musl` — Standard servers
* `aarch64-unknown-linux-musl` — ARM boards (e.g., Raspberry Pi)

 **No Rust installation required** — just download the binary and execute!
