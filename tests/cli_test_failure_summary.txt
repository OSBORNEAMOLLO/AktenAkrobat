Test Failures Summary:
------------------------
❌ test_export_csv
❌ test_predict_risk_command_runs
❌ test_predict_risk_json_exports_file

All these tests failed due to:
 - `assertion failed: output.status.success()`
Which means the subprocess command in those tests exited with a non-zero code.
Likely Causes:
 - CLI subcommand not recognized
 - Required files are missing (e.g., mock_data/merged_output.csv)
 - The tested command does not produce expected output
 - Wrong flags or file paths in the test

Suggested Fixes:
 - Ensure all required data files are present and accessible
 - Print the actual output (`stdout` and `stderr`) from the command to debug
 - Rerun the failed command manually to observe error details
